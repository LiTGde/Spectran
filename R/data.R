#'   \item{AS_wide}{A table of action spectra for the 5 human receptor types and V(lambda) from 1924. The table is in the wide format. The unit of the wavelength (Wellenlaenge) is nm, the unit of the action spectrum is 1 (dimensionless).}
#'   \item{AS_long}{A table of action spectra for the 5 human receptor types and V(lambda) from 1924. The table is in the long format. The unit of the wavelength (Wellenlaenge) is nm, the unit of the action spectrum is 1 (dimensionless).}
#'   \item{Efficacy}{A named vector of inverse values of efficacy of luminous radiation for the 5 human receptor types and V(lambda) from 1924. The unit is lm/W.}
#'   \item{Alpha}{A list. `names` contains the names of the 5 human receptor types. `adjectives` contains these names in their adjective form for every languages included in Spectran. `descriptions` contains the descriptions used for tables and plotting. `abb` contains the abbreviations (if any) used for the equivalent daylight illuminance for that receptor type.}
#'   \item{Vlambda}{A character scalar containing the properly escaped version of V(lambda), used e.g. in Plots}
#'   \item{Alpha.ico}{A character scalar containing the properly escaped version of the sign `alpha`, used e.g. in Plots}
#'   \item{Plot}{A table of Peak Wavelength (nm) values, Names, Abbreviations, and colors for the 5 human receptor types and V(lambda) from 1924. This table is mainly used for plotting.}

#' Hex Color pallets for Spectran
#'
#' Contains named vectors of Hex color codes for Spectran's color pallets.
#'
#' @format `ColorP` A list containing 5 elements, each a named vector of colors
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Lang}{401 colors along the spectrum that make a nice, yet nonaccurate representation of the visible spectrum. Created from a picture provided by `Dieter Lang`.}
#'   \item{Lang_bright}{same as `Lang` but with a slightly brightened version of the picture. Strikes a nice balance between "accuracy" and "nice colors". Is the default when starting [Spectran()]}
#'   \item{Dan_Bruton}{401 colors along the spectrum that were made with the `cooltools::wavelength2col()` function and are based on Fortran Code by Dan_Bruton. Probably most accurate, but black at both spectral ends, which does not represent the colors themselves but also human sensitivity to them.}
#'   \item{Rainbow}{401 colors along the spectrum that make a vibrant and pleasing, yet nonaccurate representation of the visible spectrum. Created by the [grDevices::rainbow()] function.}
#'   \item{Color_Rendering}{14 colors that represent the reference colors used to determine the color rendering index.}

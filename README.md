# Spectran

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

LiTG Spectran is a tool to analyse light spectra for visual and
non-visual (so-called melanopic) needs, wrapped up in a Shiny App.
Spectran allows for the import of spectra in various csv forms but also
provides a wide range of example spectra and even the creation of own
spectral distributions. The goal of the app is to provide easy access
and a visual overview of the spectral calculations underlying common
parameters. It isthus ideal for educational purposes or the creation of
presentation ready graphs in lighting research and application.

## Installation

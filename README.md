LiTG Spectran is a tool to analyse light spectra for visual and
non-visual (so-called melanopic) needs, wrapped up in a Shiny App.
Spectran allows for the import of spectra in various csv forms but also
provides a wide range of example spectra and even the creation of own
spectral distributions. The goal of the app is to provide easy access
and a visual overview of the spectral calculations underlying common
parameters. It isthus ideal for educational purposes or the creation of
presentation ready graphs in lighting research and application.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Spectran from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LiTGde/Spectran")
```
